    <span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome, you have found this page!!</h3>

<p>This is where l will be experimenting with web-development. This is actually my first website and has been greatly helped by 
github. This is actually my Something Awesome project and maybe your salvation!! This site may go through the content of 1917 
and maybe tips to get through it(first sem only, l hear the 2nd sem works differently). Or maybe not, if l've got no time.</p>

    <span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About me</h3>

<p>My name is Alex Jiang, student at UNSW and studing Computer Science/Commerce. l'm actually not a very interesting person,
 however l have reached the end of 1917. By far the most interesting course of the 4 courses l am currently studying. In fact l 
 have to thank, Angela and Richard for being awesome lecturers and also my tutors Steven and Bernice helping me understand the 
 content!! My openlearning profile: <a href="https://www.openlearning.com/u/alexjiang" target="_blank">GIVE ME KUDOS</a>. 
 l am lacking kudos. If you don't know what openlearning is, its the site where most of the work for 1917 is done.
 Choosing between cats and dogs, l have to say dogs win, but l dont hate cats either. l like movies and dont really like 
 reading books, mainly because l drift off when reading.</p>
