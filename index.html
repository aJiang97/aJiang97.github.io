<p>This is where l will be experimenting with web-development. This is actually my first website and has been greatly helped by 
github. This is actually my Something Awesome project and maybe your salvation!! This site may go through the content of 1917 
and maybe tips to get through it(first sem only, l hear the 2nd sem works differently). Or maybe not, if l've got no time.</p>

<a id="about me" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" 
class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About me</h3>

<p>My name is Alex Jiang, student at UNSW and studing Computer Science/Commerce. l'm actually not a very interesting person,
 however l have reached the end of 1917. By far the most interesting course of the 4 courses l am currently studying. In fact l 
 have to thank, Angela and Richard for being awesome lecturers and also my tutors Steven and Bernice helping me understand the 
 content!! My openlearning profile: <a href="https://www.openlearning.com/u/alexjiang" target="_blank">GIVE ME KUDOS</a>. 
 l am lacking kudos. If you don't know what openlearning is, its the site where most of the work for 1917 is done.
 Choosing between cats and dogs, l have to say dogs win, but l dont hate cats either. l like movies and dont really like 
 reading books, mainly because l drift off when reading.</p>

class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Creating pages manually</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your
 repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages 
 support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide 
 headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog
  support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#mentioning-users-and-teams" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
