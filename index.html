    <span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome, you have found this page!!</h3>

<p>This is where l will be experimenting with web-development. This is actually my first website and has been greatly helped by 
github. This is actually my Something Awesome project and maybe your salvation!! This site may go through the content of 1917 
and maybe tips to get through it(first sem only, l hear the 2nd sem works differently). Or maybe not, if l've got no time.</p>

<h3><a id="about me" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true">
    <span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About me</h3>

<p>My name is Alex Jiang, student at UNSW and studing Computer Science/Commerce. l'm actually not a very interesting person.
Programming languages that l have used/know about include: C and Python. Random things:
<ol>
    <li>Favourite foods include most junk foods, pizza, burgers, HSP, anything chocolate related</li>
    <li>Choosing between cats and dogs, l have to say dogs win, but l dont hate cats either.</li>
    <li> l like movies and dont really like reading books, mainly because l drift off when reading.</li>
</ol>
My openlearning profile: <a href="https://www.openlearning.com/u/alexjiang" target="_blank">GIVE ME KUDOS PLS</a>.
l am lacking kudos. If you don't know what openlearning is, its the site where most of the work for 1917 is done.</p>

<p>Reaching the end of 1917., l admit it is by far the most interesting course of the 4 courses l am currently studying. However
cmon, few things that could be better. This whole idea of a resume is great but blogging?? Honestly not many people dig this idea.
Also l still think the three assignments should have some weight in them (talking about Doomsday, Mandelbrot and Knowledge Island)
rather than indirectly affecting your marks through the resume. Also not very happy about the whole way Knowledge Island went down .
l mean, every time the tests ran, l had to blame a shit ton of other groups. Still don't know the point of it because it
"indirectly affects your marks..." actual waste of time. l also know that alot of groups abandoned the project as its not really 
worth doing, adding more groups to blame, or your Game.c looks like shit cause everyone be failing it. However l think my Game.c is
actually perfect but only passes 10-15 groups. Besides this  l have to thank, Angela and Richard for being awesome lecturers 
and also my tutors Steven and Bernice helping me understand the content!!</p>
